# Noki Ed Project Summary

## Project Overview
Noki Ed is a React-based web application that utilizes modern frontend technologies and practices. The project implements a responsive design with a sidebar navigation, theme toggling functionality, and is set up for easy expansion with additional features.

## Tech Stack
- React (with Vite as the build tool)
- Redux (using Redux Toolkit for state management)
- Material-UI (for UI components and theming)
- SCSS (for custom styling)
- React Router (for navigation)

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Redux State Management
- Configured Redux store using Redux Toolkit
- Created a theme slice for managing application theme state

### 2. Theming
- Implemented light/dark mode toggling using Material-UI and Redux
- Created a ThemeToggle component for user interaction

### 3. Responsive Layout
- Designed a responsive layout with a sidebar navigation
- Sidebar collapses to a hamburger menu on smaller screens

### 4. Environment Configuration
- Set up development and production environment files
- Configured Vite to use environment variables, including non-VITE prefixed variables

### 5. Routing
- Implemented client-side routing using React Router
- Created placeholder pages for Home and About

## Key Components

  ### ThemeToggle Component
  ### Redux Theme Slice

## Next Steps
1. Implement actual content for Home, and About pages
2. Add user authentication and authorization
3. Integrate with a backend API
4. Implement error handling and loading states
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Optimize for performance (lazy loading, code splitting)
7. Enhance accessibility features

## Development Guidelines
1. Follow the established project structure when adding new features
2. Use Redux slices for managing complex state
3. Utilize Material-UI components and theming system for consistent UI
4. Write SCSS in the `App.scss` file, using variables and mixins from the `styles` folder
5. Keep environment-specific configurations in the appropriate `.env` files
6. Ensure responsive design is maintained across all new components and pages
